# This file is a simple cheatsheet on how to easily use some of the basic features/concepts of kubernetes in your workFlow
# This assumes you have some working knowledge of how kubernetes works and that you have kubectl installed and configured.



# Create a Deployment for you containerized app
1. kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx:1.20.2 --port=80 --replicas=3 --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deploy.yaml ==> create deploymen manifest yaml file called
   nginx-deploy.yaml

2. kubectl apply -f nginx-deploy.yaml ==> create deployment from previously created manifest file (nginx-deploy.yaml)



# Create and  expose your app (endpoints) to outside connections using the nodeport service
1. kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --name=web-service --type=NodePort ==> create and expose nginx-deployment to the outside world



# Verify all objects have been created
1. kubectl get deploy,rs,po,svc  ==> List all ojects i.e deployments, replicaSets, pods, services

2. kubectl describe deploy,rs,po,svc ==> View detailed information about your objects

OR

3. <kubernetes cluster-name> dashboard  ==> view all information about your clusters on the dashboard

You can either curl <Ip address> or use your browser to verify that you application is up and running.
